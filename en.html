        <h1>Cheston Rewly's Blog</h1>
        <p>Hi,Welcome! This is my personal website, which can also be called my blog. I will be updating my blog from time to time. I usually use OYAMIBE (EBIMAYO in reverse), OgniToAll (or Ogni2411) and Cheston Rewly as usernames.</p>
        <p>All normally published scores will be published in "Roside Modern Music PH. (RMMP)" and "Roside Digital Score PH. (RMMP)" and "Roside Digital Score PH. (RDSP)", the former being a publication of my personal works and the latter a publication of Urtext scores of classical and romantic composers. Although it is called a publication, it is actually an electronic publication and does not have the character of a general publication. All published scores are <b>free and open to the public</b>, but <b>copyright remains</b>. Some of the completed scores can be downloaded from another page on this website.

        <p>I can't write html, so I'm stuck with a very rudimentary blog. It's 19:27 and I'm thinking about adding a download page. By the way, the two images above don't show up locally for me, I don't know what happens when I upload them to github.</p>
        <p>20:21, after uploading to github, the image displays correctly, I just forgot to adjust the width. Added the English version by the way, even though I know no one will read it.</p>
        <p><b>2023/10/2</b></p>
        <p>I'm going to update the blog again today, I've been learning the five-stroke(Wu-Bi) input method lately and I seem to be remembering more. Incidentally, I actually use DeepL to translate the English version.</p>
